            <li>Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel (31 October 1875 – 15 December 1950), endeared as Sardar, was an Indian statesman. He is also called the "Unifier of India".</li>
            <li>The Statue of Unity, the world's tallest statue, was dedicated to him on 31 October 2018 and is approximately 182 metres (597 ft) in height. He served
                 as the first Deputy Prime Minister of India from 1947 to 1950. He was a barrister and a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a leading 
                 role in the country's struggle for independence, guiding its integration into a united, independent nation.</li>
            <li>He was one of the conservative members of the Indian National Congress. In India and elsewhere, he was often called Sardar, meaning "chief" in Hindi, Urdu, and Persian</li>
            <li>He acted as the Home Minister during the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.</li>
            <li>Patel was born in Nadiad, Kheda district, and raised in the countryside of the state of Gujarat.[5] He was a successful lawyer. One of Mahatma Gandhi's earliest political lieutenants,
                 he organised peasants from Kheda, Borsad, and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of the most influential leaders in Gujarat. </li>
            <li>He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress, organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937 while promoting the Quit India Movement.</li>
            <li>As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for partition refugees fleeing to Punjab and Delhi from Pakistan and worked to restore peace. 
                He led the task of forging a united India, successfully integrating into the newly independent nation those British colonial provinces that formed the Dominion of India.</li>
            <li>Besides those provinces that had been under direct British rule, approximately 565 self-governing princely states had been released from British suzerainty by the Indian Independence Act of 1947. </li>
            <li>Patel persuaded almost every princely state to accede to India. His commitment to national integration in the newly independent country was total and uncompromising, earning him the sobriquet "Iron Man of India".</li>
